x = 2

print("x")
# It's going to print x as a Str

print('x')
# It's going to print x as a Str

print(x)
# It's going to print the value of variable, so it's going to show 2

print("x+1")
# the expression type is a string, so it's going to show exactly what we write inside of double qoutation


# print('x'+1)
# Sorry for part 'e' of excercise ,it's gonna occure an error , cause we are trying to do a math operation to a str

print(x+1)
# it's so simple it's going to show 3 , As the result of 2+1=3
